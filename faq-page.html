                <h3>Here are your Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>
            </div>
            <div id="faqContent">
                <h3>What is CBD?</h3>
                <p>CBD is an acronym for Cannabidiol (Can-a-bid-i-ol), which is a naturally occurring class of molecules found in commercial/industrial Hemp. CBD is a nonpyschoactive and thus a federally legal compound that possesses a plethora of benefits to its users.<br><br>
                CBD works in the body by activating a network of neuron receptors in the brain and nervous system called the Endocannabinoid System (ECS). The ECS runs throughout your body regulating a variety of biological processes such as relaxation, eating, sleeping, certain inflammation responses, cognitive functionality, and overall homeostasis. One could say that human evolution has hard wired us to be extremely receptive to CBD as the ECS interacts with all other major systems throughout the body. Simply put, CBD creates harmony throughout the body when it binds to the ECS, by stimulating beneficial changes in how our bodies' numerous systems interact with one and another.    
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Is CBD oil legal?</h3>
                <p>Yes! CBD oil is legal in all 50 states and is currently one of the most popular supplements on the market. Green Leaf  Isolates contain 0% THC in them, and all Full spectrum products are designed to be well under the legal limit of 0.3% THC content. In fact Green Leaf Full Spectrum products contain only 0.1% THC which is a third of what the legal limits are throughout the United States and the majority of countries worldwide.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>How do I use Hemp Vape?</h3>
                <p>Hemp Vape is easy to load into your e-cig cartridges and tanks. Simply fill the dropper and squeeze it into the side of your cartridge or vape tank. Screw on the mouth piece, and vape away.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Does Hemp Vape come in flavors?</h3>
                <p>Hemp Vape was designed to be a flavorless vape additive so that you can add CBD to any and all Vape Juices / E-Liquids. It mixes well with all known E-Liquids, and is designed with our users preference of flavor profile in mind.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>What are the effects of CBD vape oil?</h3>
                <p>Based on customer reviews, there are less CBD vape oil effects when being compared to other methods of administering CBD tinctures, capsules, and concentrates. Compared to smoking or vaporizing, ingesting cannabinoids orally poses a number of drawbacks, including inconsistent absorption and a delayed effect.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Where can I find 3rd party testing results for your CBD?</h3>
                <p>There is a page or link in our site that will take you to our 3rd party lab testing results.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Where can I purchase Hemp Vape products?</h3>
                <p>You can find our products in your local smoke shops, CBD stores, and convenience stores currently. If you do not see them there please refer your local shops to our website, and upon request one of our customer service agents will get them an order ready to go so that your CBD needs are met.</p>
